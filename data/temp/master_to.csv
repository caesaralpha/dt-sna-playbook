TO.01,Protection,"In Deep Transition theory, 'protection' refers to creating 'niche spaces' for nascent radical innovations to shield them from the dominant socio-technical regime's selection pressures, allowing them to mature and eventually challenge established rules."
TO.02,Learning,"Central to Deep Transitions and Transformative Innovation Policy, 'learning' involves continuous experimentation, reflection, and adaptation within complex systems. This includes 'second-order learning' where fundamental assumptions and routines are questioned and transformed, not just refined."
TO.03,Network creation,"Building new networks and strengthening existing ones is crucial for fostering collaboration among diverse actors (e.g., policymakers, researchers, investors, civil society) to collectively challenge and reshape dominant socio-technical systems, as emphasized in TIPC's approach to systemic change."
TO.04,Expectation management,"In transformative change, managing expectations involves setting realistic goals for the pace and scope of change, acknowledging complexity and uncertainty, and avoiding over-promising or under-delivering to maintain legitimacy and commitment among stakeholders, as per Theory of Change principles."
TO.05,Scaling up,"Within transitions, 'scaling up' refers to expanding successful innovations and practices from niches to broader societal levels, influencing mainstream systems. This goes beyond mere diffusion to include systemic changes in rules, institutions, and infrastructures."
TO.06,Replication,"The replication of successful transformative experiments or innovations in different contexts or geographical areas, contributing to the broader diffusion and normalization of new practices and challenging the universality of old meta-rules, as seen in the spread of industrial modernity during the First Deep Transition."
TO.07,Anchoring,"Anchoring involves embedding new ideas, values, or practices within existing or emerging institutions and societal structures, making them more stable and resistant to reversal, thus contributing to the long-term directionality of a Deep Transition."
TO.08,Institutionalization,"The process by which novel practices, rules, and norms become formally adopted and integrated into the established structures of society, including policies, regulations, and organizational routines. This is a key step in solidifying a new meta-regime in a Deep Transition."
TO.09,Unlearning,"Crucial for Deep Transitions, 'unlearning' means actively abandoning or questioning existing knowledge, routines, and assumptions that are no longer fit for purpose. This is essential to break free from the path dependencies of the 'First Deep Transition' and enable truly transformative change."
TO.10,Coalition dissolution,"The natural or strategic disbandment of coalitions formed to drive change, often occurring when their objectives are met, or when new phases of a transition require different configurations of actors. This is a dynamic aspect of the multi-actor governance within transformative processes."
TO.11,Deinstitutionalization,"The process of weakening or dismantling existing institutions, norms, and practices that are part of an unsustainable socio-technical regime. This is a critical, often contested, aspect of a Deep Transition, creating space for new, more sustainable alternatives."
TO.12,Delegitimization of visions,"Challenging and undermining the taken-for-granted legitimacy of dominant narratives, visions, or technological pathways that underpin unsustainable systems. This can create a cognitive opening for alternative, transformative visions to gain traction."
TO.13,Anticipate and mitigate injustices,"A core principle of 'just transitions' within the Deep Transition framework, this involves proactively identifying and addressing potential social inequalities, burdens, or exclusions that might arise from transformative changes, ensuring benefits are distributed equitably."
TO.14,Anticipate and mitigate side effects / rebound effects,"Recognizing that system changes can have unintended consequences. In Deep Transitions, this means foresight to identify and design interventions that minimize negative side effects (e.g., environmental, social) or rebound effects (where efficiency gains lead to increased consumption), as a focus for Transformative Innovation Policy."
TO.15,Establishing acceptable limits,"Defining and institutionalizing boundaries for human activity and resource use, often based on planetary boundaries or social equity considerations. This is fundamental for steering the 'Second Deep Transition' towards a sustainable and just future, moving beyond the unchecked growth of the 'First Deep Transition'."
TO.16,Resilience building,"Enhancing the capacity of socio-technical systems to absorb shocks, adapt to change, and transform towards desired pathways. In the context of Deep Transitions, this includes fostering adaptive governance and community capacities to navigate large-scale, systemic transformations."
